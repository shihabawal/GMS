    <a><h2>Overview of the System</h2></a>     <p> The system we have designed is one that performs garbage monitoring at an extensive scale. It employs sensors within multiple garbage disposals and collects information regarding the occupancy of the garbage bin. Occupancy is divided into three sections: low, moderate and high, which are determined using two proximity sensors placed at one-third and two-thirds along the length of the bin. This information is then transmitted to the required authorities, via the Internet, in order to prevent coagulation of waste, thus avoiding pollution of the environment. The purpose of this system is to achieve an efficient waste disposal system. This system is time efficient as only garbage bins with high level of occupancy will be visited and also improves the environmental conditions.

The overall goal of this system is to attain an efficient waste disposal system. The garbage monitoring system is not only time efficient, but also an environmentally friendly system. Because garbage collectors can check which garbage bins have high levels of garbage that needs to be collected, this reduces the carbon dioxide and other greenhouse emissions from the trips to the sites. Also, because a notification is sent as soon as the garbage level reaches a certain threshold, this reduces the pollution of the area.
